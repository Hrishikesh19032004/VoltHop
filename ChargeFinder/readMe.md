Has Some Errors 

### **Methods and Tools Used:**

1. **Selenium WebDriver**: Used to automate web interactions and scrape data dynamically.
2. **ChromeDriver & WebDriver Manager**: Manages ChromeDriver installation and execution.
3. **Headless Mode**: The script runs Chrome in the background without opening a browser window.
4. **Scrolling Mechanism**: `Keys.PAGE_DOWN` is used to scroll and load more charging stations dynamically.
5. **Element Selection**: `find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "station-list__item")` is used to extract relevant data.
6. **Data Extraction**: Individual station names, locations, and availability details are retrieved using class names.

### **Errors or Issues Encountered:**

1. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Some elements might not load instantly, causing `NoSuchElementException`. Adding `time.sleep()` mitigates this but isn't optimal.
2. **Anti-Scraping Measures**: The site may use automation detection (`disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` helps bypass it).
3. **Class Name Changes**: If the website structure updates, the script might fail to find elements.
4. **Incomplete Data Retrieval**: Some stations might not have all required details, causing exceptions (handled using `try-except`).
5. **Blocking/Rate Limiting**: Excessive requests may trigger IP blocking. Using proxies or random delays can help.

Would you like to optimize the script to handle these issues better? ðŸš€
